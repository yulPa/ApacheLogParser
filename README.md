### yulparserApache 

Simple Apache log parser that will return a Json string containing counters from a log file input. 

What counters to expect ? 

  * `METHOD_HTTPCODE`: All HTTP method seen in the log associated with they HTTP CODE will be count.
```shell
$ "GET_200":17255,"GET_301":145,"GET_304":58,"GET_404":348,"GET_500":29,"HEAD_200":116,"POST_200":29,
```
  * `EXT_EXTENSION`: Number of time a specific extension has been found in the log file
```shell
$ "EXT_css":2494,"EXT_gif":377,"EXT_ico":87,"EXT_jpg":2725,"EXT_js":4814,"EXT_pdf":29,"EXT_png":6032,"EXT_woff":87,"EXT_xhtml":1
```
  * `TotalBytes`: Size of response in bytes, excluding HTTP headers generated by all requests in the log
```shell
"TotalBytes":1947134994}
```
  
The full json string will look like this : 

```shell
./main -log=/var/log/apache2/access_log
`{"EXT_css":2494,"EXT_gif":377,"EXT_ico":87,"EXT_jpg":2725,"EXT_js":4814,"EXT_pdf":29,"EXT_png":6032,"EXT_woff":87,"EXT_xhtml":1,"EXT_xml":29,"GET_200":17255,"GET_301":145,"GET_304":58,"GET_404":348,"GET_500":29,"HEAD_200":116,"POST_200":29,"TotalBytes":1947134994}`
```
